## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or higher — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- **MongoDB** running locally on port 27017, **or** a MongoDB Atlas connection string
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**

---

## 🚀 Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modelsuite-ai/modelsuite-qualification.git
cd modelsuite-qualification
```

### 2. Configure the backend

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `server/.env` and fill in your values:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/task-pipeline
JWT_SECRET=your-random-secret-string-here
PORT=5000
```

> Use a long random string for `JWT_SECRET`. You can generate one with:
> ```bash
> node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
> ```

### 3. Install backend dependencies

```bash
# You should be in the /server directory
npm install
```

### 4. Seed the database

This creates 1 Admin user, 2 Talent users, and 5 sample tasks.

```bash
npm run seed
```

**Seed credentials:**

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | `admin@test.com` | `password123` |
| Talent | `talent1@test.com` | `password123` |
| Talent | `talent2@test.com` | `password123` |

### 5. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

---

## 💻 Running the Application

You need **two terminals open simultaneously**.

**Terminal 1 — Start the backend server**
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

**Terminal 2 — Start the frontend**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```
The app will open at `http://localhost:5173`

## 👥 User Roles & Flows

- **Dashboard** (`/admin/dashboard`) — view task stats and manage all tasks
- **Tasks** (`/admin/tasks`) — same as dashboard (create, edit, delete tasks, assign to talents)
- **Submissions** (`/admin/submissions`) — review talent submissions, approve or reject

### Talent
- Log in at `/login` or register at `/register`
- **Dashboard** (`/talent/dashboard`) — browse available (Open) tasks and claim one
- Claimed tasks appear in **My Tasks** section with a Submit button
- Submit a task by uploading a file and adding notes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"MongooseError: connect ECONNREFUSED"**
→ MongoDB is not running. Start it with `mongod` or use a MongoDB Atlas URI in `MONGO_URI`.

**"JsonWebTokenError: invalid signature"**
→ `JWT_SECRET` in your `.env` doesn't match the one used to sign existing tokens. Re-run `npm run seed` or clear localStorage in your browser.

**Port already in use**
→ Change `PORT` in `server/.env`. The Vite dev server port can be changed in `client/vite.config.js`.

**Upload files not saving**
→ The `server/uploads/` directory must be writable. It is tracked in git via `.gitkeep` — ensure it exists.

## 🤝 Contribution and Qualification

Welcome! If you are participating in a qualification assessment or contributing to this repository, please follow the strict process outlined below to ensure a smooth evaluation.

### 1. Branch Naming & Assignment
Every candidate is assigned a unique branch name via email (in the format: `27-26-22-7-5-pranav-test`). 
**You must use this exact branch name** for your local work and remote pushing. Your Pull Request title must also be exactly this branch name.

### 2. Cloning the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine and checking out your assigned branch:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/modelsuite-ai/modelsuite-qualification.git
cd modelsuite-qualification
git checkout -b <your-assigned-branch-name>
```

### 3. Making Changes & Local Checks
Before committing your code, please ensure it meets the project standards. Run the following checks locally:
- **Client**: `cd client && npm run lint && npm run build`
- **Server**: `cd server && npm run lint && npm run build`

### 4. Raising a Pull Request (PR)
When you are ready to submit your work:
1. Push your branch to the repository.
2. Open a Pull Request against the `master` branch.
3. **PR Title**: Ensure the title exactly matches your assigned branch name.
4. **PR Template**: Fill out the provided PR template thoroughly. This includes:
   - A brief summary of your changes.
   - Checking off the pre-flight checklists (local linting, builds, etc.).
   - Noting files touched and any relevant testing instructions.
   *Incomplete templates may result in your PR being closed.*

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline & Checks
We have an automated CI/CD pipeline that runs on every PR against `master`. It performs:
- **Danger Checks**: Automated PR review tasks.
- **Client & Server Checks**: Linting and building for both frontend and backend.

**⚠️ Important:** If your PR fails any of these checks (e.g., due to lint errors, build failures, or Danger failures), **the pipeline will automatically close your PR** and leave a comment with the failure logs. Please fix the issues locally before submitting.
